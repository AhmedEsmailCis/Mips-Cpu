WARNING:Xst:1710 - FF/Latch <DATA_30> (without init value) has a constant value of 0 in block <INSTRMEMORY>. This FF/Latch will be trimmed during the optimization process.
INFO:Xst:2261 - The FF/Latch <DATA_6> in Unit <INSTRMEMORY> is equivalent to the following 4 FFs/Latches, which will be removed : <DATA_7> <DATA_8> <DATA_9> <DATA_10> 
WARNING:Xst:3001 - This design contains one or more registers or latches with an active
   asynchronous set and asynchronous reset. While this circuit can be built,
   it creates a sub-optimal implementation in terms of area, power and
   performance. For a more optimal implementation Xilinx highly recommends
   one of the following:

          1) Remove either the set or reset from all registers and latches if
             not needed for required functionality
          2) Modify the code in order to produce a synchronous set
             and/or reset (both is preferred)
          3) Use the -async_to_sync option to transform the asynchronous
             set/reset to synchronous operation
             (timing simulation highly recommended when using this option)

  Please refer to http://www.xilinx.com search string "Artix7 asynchronous set/reset" for more details.
